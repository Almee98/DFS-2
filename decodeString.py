# Time Complexity : O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.
# Space Complexity : O(n), because we are using a stack to store the numbers and strings.
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No

# Approach:
# We will use 2 stacks to store the 1)numbers and 2)strings.
# If we encounter a digit, we will update the current number.
# If we encounter an alphabet, we will update the current string.
# If we encounter a '[', it means that we have reached a nested string, and so we will need to decode that first.
# We will preserve the state of the parent string and the number associated with it in the stacks.
# If we encounter a ']', it means that we have reached the end of a nested string, and now we need to decode it.
# We will pop the number and repeat the current string that many times.
# Finally, we will return the decoded string.
